## Workflow

---Preselection---

src/Presel_CorrSyst.cc:
Process flashgg n-tuples (central & systematics). Apply corrections and parts of preselection.
Run with script/Presel_basic.py
Output:
    Presel_basic/
    Systematics/Presel_basic/

src/Presel_had.cc Presel_lep.cc Presel_photonIDMVA.cc Presel_btag.cc:
Apply further preselection on each sample.
Run with script/Presel_general.py
Central:
    input: Presel_basic/
    output: Presel_had_phID_btag-L/ Presel_lep_phID/
Systematics:
    input: Systematics/Presel_basic/
    output: Systematics/Presel_had_phID_btag-L/ Systematics/Presel_lep_phID/

Note:
- After preselection, in leptonic channel "QCD_Pt-30to40_MGG-80toInf" sample doesn't have any
  event left.


---Normalization---

macro/NormFactor/NormFactor.cc:
Calculate and save norm factors for MC samples.
For samples with multiple root files, call SumWeight.sh to calculate sum of genweight.
SumWeight.sh uses CreateWeight.cc & src/AddWeight.cc.
Input: flashgg n-tuples
Output:
    sumweight/
    normfactor/


---Scale Factors---

src/SFcalc_PU.cc SFcalc_Electron.cc SFcalc_Muon.cc:
Calculate SFs and add them to event tree. The original tree is overwritten.
Run with script/AddScaleFactors.py
For signal MC & resonant bkg MC, systematic uncertainty weights are also saved.
Input:
    hadronic: Presel_had_phID_btag-L/
    leptonic: Presel_lep_phID/

src/SFcalc_btag_factor.cc:
Calculate b-tagging SF extrapolation factor for each MC sample.
Run with script/AddScaleFactors.py
Run before applying any cut on b-tagging score.
Input:
    hadronic: Presel_had_phID/
    leptonic: Presel_lep_phID/
Output:
    hadronic: SFbtag_extrapolation_had/
    leptonic: SFbtag_extrapolation_lep/
Note: Run SFcalc_PU, SFcalc_Electron, SFcalc_Muon first on the samples.

src/SFcalc_btag.cc:
Calculate b-tagging SF & add them to event tree. The original tree is overwritten.
Run with script/AddScaleFactors.py
For signal MC & resonant bkg MC, systematic uncertainty weights are also saved.
Input:
    hadronic: Presel_had_phID_btag-L/ SFbtag_extrapolation_had/
    leptonic: Presel_lep_phID/ SFbtag_extrapolation_lep/

src/MakeWeight.cc:
Calculate event weight for MC samples after getting all SFs.
Run with script/AddScaleFactors.py
For signal MC & resonant bkg MC, event weight with syst uncertainty variation is also saved.
Input:
    hadronic: Presel_had_phID_btag-L/
    leptonic: Presel_lep_phID/

src/MakeWeight_data.cc:
Adding SFs & event weights to data tree to make it consistent with MC trees.
Central SFs & weight are saved as 1 and syst uncertainty SFs & weights are saved as -999.
Input:
    hadronic: Presel_had_phID_btag-L/data.root
    leptonic: Presel_lep_phID/data.root

script/AddScaleFactors_syst.py:  (to be run)
Add SFs to systematic trees.
Warning: Run all trees together will occupy hundreds of GBs volumn!
Input:
    hadronic: Systematics/Presel_had_phID_btag-L/
    leptonic: Systematics/Presel_lep_phID/
b-tag factor:
    hadronic: SFbtag_extrapolation_had/
    leptonic: SFbtag_extrapolation_lep/
