## Workflow

---Preselection---

src/Presel_CorrSyst.cc:
Process flashgg n-tuples (central & systematics). Apply corrections and parts of preselection.
Run with script/Presel_basic.py
Output:
    Presel_basic/
    Systematics/Presel_basic/

src/Presel_had.cc Presel_lep.cc Presel_photonIDMVA.cc Presel_btag.cc:
Apply further preselection on each sample.
Run with script/Presel_general.py
Central:
    input: Presel_basic/
    output: Presel_had_phID_btag-L/ Presel_lep_phID/
Systematics:
    input: Systematics/Presel_basic/
    output: Systematics/Presel_had_phID_btag-L/ Systematics/Presel_lep_phID/


---Normalization---

macro/NormFactor/NormFactor.cc:
Calculate and save norm factors for MC samples.
For samples with multiple root files, call SumWeight.sh to calculate sum of genweight.
SumWeight.sh uses CreateWeight.cc & src/AddWeight.cc.
Input: flashgg n-tuples
Output:
    sumweight/
    normfactor/
